# bb-type-ahead
This is a readme for the Type ahead field custom plugin.

# Description
A component used for querying tables or data providers, searching through results, selecting and then saving selected items back to the db.

## Configuration

### General Section
This has your main elements; your table select, types and fields.\

* The **Table** field populates the selectable fields which can be binded to. **REQUIRED**
* You can also use a **Data Provider** query as the source instead of a table.
* **Type**, there are 3 different types, these change which fields can be selected. **REQUIRED**
* **Field**, this is used to select the field you wish to target/save back to the database after selecting. **REQUIRED**

### Configuration Section
This section is all related to functionality within the component itself.\

* **Limit**, this limits the number of results you can get back, the default being 25 and the max being 1000.
* **Type**, works similarily to the one within general however theres only 2 instead of 3. **REQUIRED**
  * The standard field type search isn't case senative.
  * Array type only works for exact searches **including case**. (Currently you can't search for more than one option using this.)  
* **Search Field**, selectable which you wish to search against. **REQUIRED**
* **Label**, field used to for visible select options in the frontend.
* **Value**, field ussed for the hidden values for binding/saving back to the database.

## Disclaimer
You can search on arrays e.g. multi-select columns within Budibase. However you can only search one of the values within these. In the future I may expand this to search for multiple valeus within these field types.
